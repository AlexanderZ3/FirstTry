# This repository is mainly for recording the exercises for python3.
I practice the python3 from two sources:
1. Learn python the hard way. This is a basic, useful and beautiful handbook which is also full of fun.
   The author is an experienced programmer, and he would like to teache us not only how to code using python
   but the good coding habits.
2. The Leetcode.com problems. For now I have solved some medium problems and after many practice, I believe it
   will get eaiser and easier for coding.

   You can code, They can not, it's pretty damn cool!
